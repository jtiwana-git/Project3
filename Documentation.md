# PROJECT 3

We going to create a full stack web app of your choice. This web app should
have CRUD functionality and link to a database, with a well designed front-end and a working back-end that includes a database. The app should demonstrate the full width and breadth of knowledge that you have acquired during the course, as well as your own learning. You will then present your app, with a walkthrough of all its features and design implementations, at the end of the course. You will also be writing up documentation for the app, that includes your ustification for requirements.The approach you take with this project is entirely up to you. Some examples previous learners have made: an eCommerce shop, a social media clone, a journalling app.

• Front End: Your website must have an attractive and dynamic front end that
allows for user interactivity. It should be responsive, so that it looks good on
different screen sizes. The interface should be user-friendly, with a consistent navigation and layout for seamless user experience. There should be ability to interact with the database in a secure way. The front￾end should be accessible and comply with web accessibility standards.

• Back End: Your app needs to have a working back end which deals with all route requests and works with the database. Interaction with APIs (if an API is used) and the database should be done in a secure way. There should be an ability for user log in or account creation, and user credentials should be stored in a secure way.

• Documentation: You need to have written documentation/report for your project. This is an amalgamation for of documentation and a learner report. This will demonstrate your thinking and justifications for your web app, its implementations and features.
